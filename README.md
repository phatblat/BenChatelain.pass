My business card as an Apple Wallet pass.
The intent of publishing this example Apple Wallet pass is so that you can quickly create your own.
However, please change the contents and don't pretend to be me. That would just be silly.

## ðŸ“² Install

Open the following link on an device that supports Apple Wallet (iOS or macOS):

- [https://phatbl.at/pass](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/phatblat/phatblat.pkpass)

ðŸ“· Alternatively, use the camera app on your device to scan the QR code:

## Making Your Own

### Pass Configuration

My pass uses the "Generic" style, which is the best fit for a business card.
There are different sets of fields and design options available for each of the
different pass types.

The configuration and assets are all located in the [`phatblat.pass`](blob/master/phatblat.pass) folder.
The [`pass.json`](blob/master/phatblat.pass/pass.json) contains all the configuration of the pass.
Image assets reside next to it and have specific names, depending on their purpose for
a given pass type.

### Pass Signing

Once you've configured the pass and added assets, you will need to
[sign and compress](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/YourFirst.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012195-CH2-SW28)
the pass package. Note that you will need to
[Create a Pass Type Id & Pass Signing Certificate](https://www.skycore.com/help/creating-pass-signing-certificate/).

This repo contains a copy of Apple's sample `signpass` macOS
CLI command, which can be built and run all with the following command:

```bash
make pass
```

See the `Makefile` for the underlying commands.

## Signing Errors

### Missing Identity

> 2022-09-03 11:19:45.945 signpass[30634:6699251] Couldn't find an identity for pass.com.example.YourPass

This error means that it couldn't find a valid certificate for your pass type ID.
Use the help links above in the **Pass Signing** section.

### Missing WWDR Certificate

> Warning: unable to build chain to self-signed root for signer "Pass Type ID: pass.com.example.YourPass"

If you get an error like the following, it means that you are missing one of the
certificates in the trust chain that your signing certificate depends on.
This is well explained in this [pinned answer](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/706556).
The solution involves downloading the missing certificate from the [Apple PKI](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/)
page.
